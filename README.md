# Mock IMDB Movies Scores
## The project is associated with IEEE Alex SC. It explores a mock IMDB movie scores dataset and tries to answer the following questions:
* What are the directors that have the lowest and highest mean budget-to-score ratio?
* Do people give higher scores to movies with longer or shorter duration?
* Which year had the highest budget spent on movies and what are those movies?
* Which two actors worked together in movies most?
* Who are the top 3 actors Steven Spielberg favors most as main actors?
* Do movies with a high budget usually have high scores?
* Which country has the highest average spending per movie?
* Do movies with more genres usually have higher scores?
* Does a higher duration of films tend to come with a higher budget?
* Which director and country made the most diversified movie languages?
